<div class="about">
  <p> Comet is a game where you crash land on a toxic wasteland after fighting to defend your spaceship from pirates and are almost obliterated. Stranded, and struggling to survive with crewmates, you scramble together resources to repair your spaceship and attempt to return back to somewhere safe to repair your ship fully, whilst avoiding enemy ships and other hazards.</p>
  <p> Will you survive the perilous journey to return back home? Or will you buckle under pressure and crash-land, ending your journey? Find out in late 2024 when Comet releases! </p>
