<div class="about">
  <p> Comet is a game where you crash land on a toxic wasteland after responding to a nearby distress call and are almost obliterated. Stranded, and struggling to survive with your up to 3 teammates, you scramble together resources to repair your spaceship and attempt to return back to somewhere safe to repair your ship fully, whilst avoiding enemy ships and other hazards.</p>
  <p> Will you survive the perilous journey to return back home? Or will you buckle under pressure and crash-land, ending your journey? Find out in early 2024 when Comet releases! </p>
